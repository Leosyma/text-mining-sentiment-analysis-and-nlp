# üìù Text Mining and NLP

This project explores foundational techniques in Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python. It includes practical examples of text preprocessing, word frequency analysis, n-grams, and sentiment analysis using real-world datasets. The code is divided across three notebooks, building progressively on NLP concepts.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### 1. Text Preprocessing and Tokenization
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Text normalization (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopwords)
  - Tokenization using `nltk`
  - Word cloud and frequency distribution analysis
  - Extraction of n-grams (bigrams and trigrams)

### 2. Sentiment Analysis with VADER
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Polarity classification using `VADER` sentiment analyzer
  - Application of sentiment scoring to individual texts
  - Aggregation and visualization of sentiment distributions

### 3. Exploratory Text Analytics
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Corpus analysis with `CountVectorizer`
  - Text feature extraction
  - Term frequency analysis for insight into most relevant terms
  - Data visualization with word clouds and bar plots
